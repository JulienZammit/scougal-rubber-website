## Why Choose Elastomeric Bearing Pads?

Elastomeric bearing pads are critical for accommodating movement, absorbing stress, and isolating vibrations in structures. They are a versatile solution used in bridges, industrial projects, and even architectural designs requiring vibration isolation. Scougal’s bearing pads are designed to meet the exacting standards of engineers while offering flexibility in customization.

## Versatility in Design and Application

### Laminated Bearing Pads

Laminated bearing pads incorporate layers of steel reinforcement between elastomeric materials, combining the flexibility of rubber with the strength of steel. This construction enhances load capacity and rotational flexibility, making them ideal for bridges and heavy-duty applications. With a service life often exceeding the bridge itself, laminated pads are a long-term solution for infrastructure needs.

### Bearing Pads with Load Plates

For applications requiring additional stability, our elastomeric pads are vulcanized directly to steel load plates. This configuration ensures a secure connection, whether welded or bolted, while allowing for necessary movement. They are commonly used in sloped bridge spans and rehabilitation projects, offering quick solutions to time-critical repairs.

### Plain Bearing Pads

Plain bearing pads provide a cost-effective option for shorter span bridges and construction applications. Made from high-quality neoprene or natural rubber, these pads are ideal for expansion and contraction in precast or steel components. Despite their simpler design, they offer exceptional reliability and comply with AASHTO specifications.

---

### PTFE Slide Bearings

When greater movement is required, PTFE slide bearings step in. These pads feature a PTFE element that slides against a stainless steel surface, enabling significant longitudinal and transverse movement. Perfect for large-scale projects, PTFE slide bearings deliver high performance under demanding conditions.

## Customization and Quality Assurance

At Scougal Rubber, we understand that no two projects are alike. That’s why our bearing pads are designed with flexibility in mind. Engineers can choose from a range of materials, durometer levels, and configurations to meet specific project needs. Whether it’s adding steel reinforcements or tailoring pads for vibration isolation, our solutions are always built to perform.

Our commitment to quality extends to every stage of production. Using advanced vulcanization techniques and rigorous testing, we ensure each product meets the highest standards of durability and reliability. With certifications from AASHTO and alignment with "Buy American" standards, Scougal bearing pads deliver peace of mind.
