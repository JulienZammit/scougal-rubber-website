    title: "Introduction to Elastomeric Bearing Pads",
    description:
      "Since their US introduction in the 1950â€™s elastomeric bearing pads have become the standard for both steel and concrete bridge structures throughout North America. They are manufactured with a service life that typically exceeds that of the bridge superstructure itself. So far as we know, the first use of rubber bearings in a bridge was in Australia in 1889; a century later, these bearings were reportedly still in service.",

    modalParagraphs: [
      "In many applications, elastomeric bearing pads are vulcanized directly to heavy steel sole plates and/or masonry plates. This configuration allows for a positive connection by welding and/or bolting, while still allowing the desired range of motion. For sloped bridge spans, the top sole plate is tapered to match the slope of the bridge. Anchor bolts are used to attach the masonry plate and sometimes continue up through the sole plate to restrict movement. In addition, various restrainers can be incorporated to limit the range of motion. There is a wide range of designs to suit a variety of applications.",
      "For bridge rehabilitation projects, elastomeric bearings are frequently chosen to replace damaged or frozen steel bearing assemblies. Because an elastomeric bearing takes up much less space than an equivalent rocker bearing, Scougal provides the fabricated steel bolsters to fill in the gap between the bearing seat and the bridge superstructure. For fast track bridge repair emergencies, we take pride in our ability to meet tight deadlines for time critical projects.",

    title: "Steel Shims in Bearings",
    description:
      "Bearings with a large number of steel shims relative to the overall volume of rubber can handle higher loads and shear forces; by contrast, bearings with wider spacing of the steel shims can provide excellent vibration isolation characteristics, and are often used in theaters and concert halls. By manipulating a small number of variables, engineers can design an elastomeric bearing to suit most any application.",

    modalParagraphs: [
      "Steel-reinforced elastomeric bearing pads incorporate multiple thin steel layers between the layers of rubber. The manufacturing process uses heat and pressure to vulcanize the materials together into a homogenous unit. The presence of reinforcements limits the ability of the elastomer to bulge at the sides, and results in greatly increased longitudinal movement, compressive strength, and rotational capacity.",
      "Bearings come in either Neoprene or natural rubber, and are commonly called out in the AASHTO specification for highway bridges. They range in durometer from 50 to 70 depending on the required modulus. Steel shim thicknesses are typically 10, 11, 12 or 14 gauge per ASTM A1011. Flexible manufacturing techniques allow for bearings with holes or clipped corners in order to accommodate special conditions.",

      "Simply put, our ability to manufacture and test bearing pads for multiple applications has become our signature. From bridge bearings that require compensation for rotations, loads, and horizontal movements to buildings, light rail projects and machinery that compensate for vibrations, we can make virtually any shape or size of product desired.",

      "Scougal Rubber Corporation offers high quality Neoprene (polychloroprene) and natural rubber (polyisoprene) bearing pad material to meet AASHTO and many other specifications. Plain bearing pads are used for a variety of purposes in the bridge and construction industries. They allow for expansion and contraction of precast and steel components. The amount of movement depends on the thickness of the bearing pad. Plain elastomeric bearings are the least expensive bearing pad system. Due to their relatively low compressive strength, they are used in shorter span bridges or as a continuous strip under box beams or concrete slabs.",

    modalParagraphs: [
      "When the practical limits of steel-reinforced elastomeric bearings are exceeded, PTFE slide bearings are the choice of many designers. The steel-reinforced bearing pad is topped with a steel plate that is permanently vulcanized to the elastomer. A PTFE element is then either bonded to the surface of the plate or partially recessed into the plate. The PTFE can be sized smaller than the bearing and can be dimpled to improve the coefficient of friction. In application, the PTFE element slides against a polished stainless steel upper surface, which is welded to the underside of a steel plate attached to the supported member. PTFE slide bearings allow for the design of larger longitudinal and transverse movement than with a standard laminated pad.",
